## 1. Overview & Objectives

### Objective

- Users can add, update, delete, and view expense records.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals find it difficult to track their day-to-day expenses and understand how their income is being spent. Without a structured tracking mechanism, users may lose visibility into their spending habits and overall financial health.

The Expense Tracker Application provides a simple console-based solution that allows users to record income and expenses, categorize transactions, and view summarized financial information. This helps users make better financial decisions and maintain spending awareness.

## 3. Technical Scope

### In Scope (Version 1)

- Text-based, menu-driven console application.
- Interactive prompts for all user operations.
- Clear success and error messages.
- Menu refresh after major operations.

#### CRUD Operations

##### Create

##### Delete
- Delete income records using ID.

- Confirmation before deletion.

#### Storage
- In-memory storage using lists and/or dictionaries.
- Data available only during application execution.
- No database integration.

#### Validation
- Mandatory field validation.
- Amount validation for numeric values.
- ID validation for update and delete operations.
- Prevention of empty input values.

### Out of Scope (Version 1)
- Database integration.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Multi-user support.
- Cloud synchronization.
- Advanced search and filtering.
- Data export functionality.

### Assumptions
- Single-user application.
- Runs locally on a user machine.
- Data persistence is not required.
- Expected data volume is small.

---

## 4. Design

As Version 1 is a console-based application, no graphical user interface or wireframes are required.

The application will provide:
- Menu-driven navigation.
- Console-based user input.
- Formatted output screens for records and summaries.

---

## 5. Open Questions & Risks

### Open Questions
- Should salary remain mandatory before expense entry?
- Should custom categories exist only during the current session?
- Should reporting support date-based filtering in future versions?

### Risks
- Data will be lost when the application is terminated due to in-memory storage.
- Sequential ID generation must avoid duplicate IDs after record deletion.
- No backup or recovery mechanism exists in Version 1.

---

## 6. Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
Users can successfully perform add, view, update, and delete operations for income and expense records while maintaining accurate financial summaries.

### Secondary Metric
All validation rules prevent invalid input and display meaningful error messages.

### Guardrail
Any successful create, update, or delete operation must immediately reflect in record views and summary calculations.
